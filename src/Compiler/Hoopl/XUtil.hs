firstXfer xfer n fb = xfer n $ fromJust $ lookupFact (entryLabel n) fb

-- over the outgoing edges.

-- for a last node takes the incoming fact unchanged and simply distributes
-- that fact over the outgoing edges.
distributeFact :: NonLocal n => n O C -> f -> FactBase f
distributeFact n f = mapFromList [ (l, f) | l <- successors n ]
   -- because the same fact goes out on every edge,

-- | It's common to represent dataflow facts as a map from variables
-- to some fact about the locations. For these maps, the join
-- operation on the map can be expressed in terms of the join on each
-- element of the codomain:

joinMaps eltJoin (OldFact old) (NewFact new) = M.foldrWithKey add (NoChange, old) new
