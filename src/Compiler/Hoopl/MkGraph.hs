{-|
As noted in the paper, we can define a single, polymorphic type of 
splicing operation with the very polymorphic type
@
  AGraph n e a -> AGraph n a x -> AGraph n e x
@
However, we feel that this operation is a bit /too/ polymorphic,
and that it's too easy for clients to use it blindly without 
thinking.  We therfore split it into two operations, '<*>' and '|*><*|', 
which are supplemented by other functions:

  * The '<*>' operator is true concatenation, for connecting open graphs.
    Control flows from the left graph to the right graph.

  * The '|*><*|' operator splices together two graphs at a closed
    point. Nothing is known about control flow. The vertical bar
    stands for "closed point" just as the angle brackets above stand
    for "open point".  Unlike the <*> operator, the |*><*| can create
    a control-flow graph with dangling outedges or unreachable blocks.
    The operator must be used carefully, so we have chosen a long name
    on purpose, to help call people's attention to what they're doing.

  * The operator 'addBlocks' adds a set of basic blocks (represented
    as a closed/closed 'AGraph' to an existing graph, without changing
    the shape of the existing graph.  In some cases, it's necessary to
    introduce a branch and a label to 'get around' the blocks added,
    so this operator, and other functions based on it, requires a
    'HooplNode' type-class constraint and is available only on AGraph,
    not Graph.

  * We have discussed a dynamic assertion about dangling outedges and
    unreachable blocks, but nothing is implemented yet.
