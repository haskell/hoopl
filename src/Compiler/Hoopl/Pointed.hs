data Pointed t b a where
   Bot   ::      Pointed t C a
   PElem :: a -> Pointed t b a
   Top   ::      Pointed C b a

-- ^ The type parameters 't' and 'b' are used to say whether top
-- and bottom elements have been added.  The analogy with 'Block'
-- is nearly exact:
--
--  * A 'Block' is closed at the entry if and only if it has a first node;
--    a 'Pointed' is closed at the top if and only if it has a top element.
--
--  * A 'Block' is closed at the exit if and only if it has a last node;
--    a 'Pointed' is closed at the bottom if and only if it has a bottom element.
--
-- We thus have four possible types, of which three are interesting:
--
--  [@Pointed C C a@] Type @a@ extended with both top and bottom elements.
--
--  [@Pointed C O a@] Type @a@ extended with a top element
--  only. (Presumably @a@ comes equipped with a bottom element of its own.)
--
--  [@Pointed O C a@] Type @a@ extended with a bottom element only. 
--
--  [@Pointed O O a@] Isomorphic to @a@, and therefore not interesting.
--
-- The advantage of all this GADT-ishness is that the constructors
-- 'Bot', 'Top', and 'PElem' can all be used polymorphically.
--
-- A 'Pointed t b' type is an instance of 'Functor' and 'Show'.
